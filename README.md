This project is a modular notification system based on Java that uses generics and key software design patterns to manage different types of notifications, such as email and SMS. The system utilizes observers, abstract factories, and builder patterns to demonstrate a scalable and reusable code architecture.


The main features include:
 
General notification class encapsulating message content

An observer interface that allows observers to respond to specific notifications

Abstract factory for generating different notification types

Builder classes to configure notifications step by step

Demonstrations of Java generic concepts, such as limited wildcard and type inference
